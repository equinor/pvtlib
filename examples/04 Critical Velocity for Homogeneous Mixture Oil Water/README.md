# Critical Velocity for Homogeneous Mixture Oil Water

This example demonstrates how to calculate the critical velocity required to maintain a homogeneous water-in-oil dispersion in both horizontal and vertical pipes.

## Description

The example shows how to:
- Calculate critical velocity for uniform water-in-oil dispersion in horizontal pipes
- Calculate critical velocity for uniform water-in-oil dispersion in vertical pipes

The critical velocity is the minimum velocity needed to prevent phase separation and maintain a homogeneous mixture. This is important for accurate measurement in multiphase flow systems where you want to ensure proper mixing.

## Usage

```bash
python critical_velocity_for_homogeneous_mixture_oil_water.py
```

## Required Packages

- `pvtlib` (only)

## Output

The script calculates and prints:
- Critical velocity for horizontal pipe configuration (m/s)
- Critical velocity for vertical pipe configuration (m/s)
